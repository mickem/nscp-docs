xor = XOR
des = DES
3des = DES-EDE3
cast128 = CAST-128
xtea = XTEA
blowfish = Blowfish
twofish = Twofish

### encryption

**ENCRYPTION**

Name of encryption algorithm to use.
Has to be the same as your server i using or it wont work at all.This is also independent of SSL and generally used instead of SSL.
Available encryption algorithms are:
none = No Encryption (not safe)
xor = XOR
des = DES
3des = DES-EDE3
cast128 = CAST-128
xtea = XTEA
blowfish = Blowfish
twofish = Twofish
rc2 = RC2
aes128 = AES
aes192 = AES
aes = AES
serpent = Serpent
gost = GOST
