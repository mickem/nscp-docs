# CheckDisk

CheckDisk can check various file and disk related things.

`CheckDisk` is provides two disk related checks one for checking size of drives and the other for checking status of files and folders.

!!! danger
    Please note that UNC and network paths are only available in each session meaning a user mounted share will not be visible to NSClient++ (since services run in their own session).
    But as long as NSClient++ can access the share you can still check it as you specify the UNC path.
    In other words the following will **NOT** work: `check_drivesize drive=m:` But the following will: `check_drivesize drive=\\myserver\\mydrive`

## check_drivesize

Check the size (free-space) of a drive or volume.

### Usage

_To edit these sample please edit [this page](https://github.com/mickem/nscp-docs/blob/master/samples/CheckDisk_check_drivesize_samples.md)_

To check the size of **the C:\ drive** and **make sure it has atleast 10% free** space::

```
check_drivesize "crit=free<10%" drive=c:
L     client CRITICAL: c:: 205GB/223GB used
L     client  Performance data: 'c: free'=18GB;0;22;0;223 'c: free %'=8%;0;9;0;100
```

To check the size of **all the drives** and make sure it has at least 10% free space::

```
check_drivesize "crit=free<10%" drive=*
L     client OK: All drives ok
L     client  Performance data: 'C:\ free'=18GB;0;2;0;223 'C:\ free %'=8%;0;0;0;100 'D:\ free'=18GB;0;4;0;465 'D:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100 'M:\ free'=83GB;0;27;0;2746 'M:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100
```

To check the size of all the drives and **display all values, not just problems**::

```
check_drivesize drive=* --show-all
L     client CRITICAL: c:: 205GB/223GB used
L     client  Performance data: 'c: free'=18GB;0;22;0;223 'c: free %'=8%;0;9;0;100
```

To check the size of all the drives and **return the value in gigabytes**. By default units on performance data will be scaled to "something appropriate"::

```
check_drivesize "perf-config=*(unit:g)"
L        cli CRITICAL: CRITICAL C:\\: 208.147GB/223.471GB used, D:\\: 399.607GB/465.759GB used
L        cli  Performance data: 'C:\ used'=0.00019g;0.00017;0.00019;0;0.00021 'C:\ used %'=93%;79;89;0;100 'D:\ used'=0.00038g;0.00035;0.00039;0;0.00044 'D:\ used %'=85%;79;89;0;100 'E:\ used'=0g;0;0;0;0 '\\?\Volume{d458535f-27c7-11e4-be66-806e6f6e6963}\ used'=0g;0;0;0;0 '\\?\Volume{d458535f-27c7-11e4-be66-806e6f6e6963}\ used %'=33%;79;89;0;100
```

To check the size of **a mounted volume** (c:\volume_test) and **make sure it has 1M free** space **warn if free space is less then 10M**::

```
   check_drivesize "crit=free<1M" "warn=free<10M" drive=c:\\volume_test
   C:: Total: 74.5G - Used: 71.2G (95%) - Free: 3.28G (5%) < critical,C:;5%;10;5;
```

To check the size of **all volumes** and **make sure they have 1M space free**::

```
check_drivesize "crit=free<1M" drive=all-volumes
L     client OK: All drives ok
L     client  Performance data: 'C:\ free'=18GB;0;2;0;223 'C:\ free %'=8%;0;0;0;100 'D:\ free'=18GB;0;4;0;465 'D:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100 'E:\ free'=0B;0;0;0;0 'F:\ free'=0B;0;0;0;0
```

To check the size of **all fixed and network drives** and make sure they have at least 1gig free space::

```
check_drivesize "crit=free<1g" drive=* "filter=type in ('fixed', 'remote')"
L     client OK: All drives ok
L     client  Performance data: 'C:\ free'=18GB;0;2;0;223 'C:\ free %'=8%;0;0;0;100 'D:\ free'=18GB;0;4;0;465 'D:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100 'M:\ free'=83GB;0;27;0;2746 'M:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100
```


To check **all fixed and network drives but ignore C and F**::

```
check_drivesize "crit=free<1g" drive=* "filter=type in ('fixed', 'remote')" exclude=C:\\ exclude=D:\\
L     client OK: All drives ok
L     client  Performance data: 'M:\ free'=83GB;0;27;0;2746 'M:\ free %'=3%;0;0;0;100
```

Default via NRPE:

```
check_nrpe --host 192.168.56.103 --command check_drivesize
C:\: 205GB/223GB used, D:\: 448GB/466GB used, M:\: 2.6TB/2.68TB used|'C:\ used'=204GB;44;22;0;223 'C:\ used %'=91%;19;9;0;100 'D:\ used'=447GB;93;46;0;465...
```

<a name="check_drivesize_filter"/>
### filter


**Default Value:** mounted = 1

**Description:**
Filter which marks interesting items.
Interesting items are items which will be included in the check.
They do not denote warning or critical state instead it defines which items are relevant and you can remove unwanted items.
Available options : 

| Key            | Value                                                                                                         |

| total          |  Total number of items. Common option for all checks.                                                         |
| ok_count       |  Number of items matched the ok criteria. Common option for all checks.                                       |
| warn_count     |  Number of items matched the warning criteria. Common option for all checks.                                  |
| crit_count     |  Number of items matched the critical criteria. Common option for all checks.                                 |
| problem_count  |  Number of items matched either warning or critical criteria. Common option for all checks.                   |
| list           |  A list of all items which matched the filter. Common option for all checks.                                  |

<a name="check_drivesize_drive"/>
### drive



**Description:**
The drives to check.
Multiple options can be used to check more then one drive or wildcards can be used to indicate multiple drives to check. Examples: drive=c, drive=d:, drive=*, drive=all-volumes, drive=all-drives

<a name="check_drivesize_ignore-unreadable"/>
### ignore-unreadable



**Description:**
DEPRECATED (manually set filter instead) Ignore drives which are not reachable by the current user.
For instance Microsoft Office creates a drive which cannot be read by normal users.

<a name="check_drivesize_mounted"/>
### mounted



**Description:**
DEPRECATED (this is now default) Show only mounted rives i.e. drives which have a mount point.

<a name="check_drivesize_magic"/>
### magic



**Description:**
Magic number for use with scaling drive sizes.

<a name="check_drivesize_exclude"/>
### exclude



**Description:**
A list of drives not to check

<a name="check_drivesize_total"/>
### total



**Description:**
Include the total of all matching drives

## check_files

Check various aspects of a file and/or folder.

### Usage

_To edit these sample please edit [this page](https://github.com/mickem/nscp-docs/blob/master/samples/CheckDisk_check_files_samples.md)_

#### Performance

Order is somewhat important but mainly in the fact that some operations are more costly then others.
For instance line_count requires us to read and count the lines in each file so choosing between the following:
Fast version: `filter=creation < -2d and line_count > 100`

Slow version: `filter=line_count > 100 and creation < -2d`

The first one will be significantly faster if you have a thousand old files and 3 new ones.

On the other hand in this example `filter=creation < -2d and size > 100k` swapping them would not be noticeable.

#### Checking versions of .exe files

```
check_files path=c:/foo/ pattern=*.exe "filter=version != '1.0'" "detail-syntax=%(filename): %(version)" "warn=count > 1" show-all
L        cli WARNING: WARNING: 0/11 files (check_nrpe.exe: , nscp.exe: 0.5.0.16, reporter.exe: 0.5.0.16)
L        cli  Performance data: 'count'=11;1;0
```

#### Using the line count with limited recursion:

```
check_files path=c:/windows pattern=*.txt max-depth=1 "filter=line_count gt 100" "detail-syntax=%(filename): %(line_count)" "warn=count>0" show-all
L        cli WARNING: WARNING: 0/1 files (AsChkDev.txt: 328)
L        cli  Performance data: 'count'=1;0;0
```

### Check file sizes

```
check_files path=c:/windows pattern=*.txt "detail-syntax=%(filename): %(size)" "warn=size>20k" max-depth=1
L        cli WARNING: WARNING: 1/6 files (AsChkDev.txt: 29738)
L        cli  Performance data: 'AsChkDev.txt size'=29.04101KB;20;0 'AsDCDVer.txt size'=0.02246KB;20;0 'AsHDIVer.txt size'=0.02734KB;20;0 'AsPEToolVer.txt size'=0.08789KB;20;0 'AsToolCDVer.txt size'=0.05273KB;20;0 'csup.txt size'=0.00976KB;20;0
```

<a name="check_files_filter"/>
### filter



**Description:**
Filter which marks interesting items.
Interesting items are items which will be included in the check.
They do not denote warning or critical state instead it defines which items are relevant and you can remove unwanted items.
